# Crude TODO list
Bunch of random ideas to randomly pick up and implement

## Engine
### Physics
- [x] Circle based basic collisions
- [x] Rigid body simulation generalization to simulate other objects than tanks (still circle based)
- [ ] AABB/OBB box collisions
- [ ] Variable time step in physics calulcations
- [ ] Ray casting for collisions with objects (for further sensors implementation)

### Visuals
- [x] Fluid camera support with zoom capabilites

### GUI
- [x] Basic GUI subsystem support for spawning windows with some text
- [x] Buttons
- [x] Closable windows
- [x] Resizable windows
    - [x] 🐛: You can close window while resizing by passing cursor over close button
    - [x] 🐛: When window is first resized and then dragged it jumps to some offset position (like where topbar was before resize)
    - [x] 🐛: Window focusing is not working properly after resizing
- [x] Some basic dynamic layout support like:
  - [x] Horizontal
  - [x] Vertical
  - [x] Box (like 2x2 grid)
  - [x] Size constrains
- [x] Edit box
  - [x] Text input
  - [x] Selection support
    - [x] 🐛 Moving cursor does not clear previous selection
  - [x] Copy paste mechanic
    - [ ] 🐛 Pasting text over selected text moves cursor to wrong place
  - [ ] Current layout of text in EditBox is messy not centered vertically and buggy due to dynamic font height changes
- [x] 🐛 Event polling is generating events every render frame, also creating some nice events would be easier to handle
- [ ] 🐛 When layout constrains are exceeding maximum possible ration should fallback to auto mode, but it doesn't
- [ ] 🏎️ Render gui on separate texture and rerender only on changes
- [ ] Consider creating render command batches and split gui from sfml implementation
- [ ] Focus on controls is now marked as different hue of face, change it to classic dotted border look
- [x] Checkbox
  - [x] Implement keyboard events support
- [x] Radiobutton
  - [ ] Radio button groups support 
- [x] Sliders
- [ ] Move render logic to some renderer subclasses (so that representation of gui elements can be reimplemented)

## Gameplay
- [x] Basic waypoint travel mechanism for physics and visual testing
- [x] Shooting projectiles, every tank can do it right?
- [ ] Fuel management, pickups
- [ ] Distance sensors

## Lua API
- [ ] Some movement basic API (rotate, driving) with lua bindings
- [ ] Scanner/radar to find other tanks and pickups

## Others
- [ ] Address in code TODOs and FIXMEs :) meh
- [x] Create UT target and write few crude tests
- [ ] Build system should split production and test targets to not build UTs in production
- [x] Split github actions to run production and UT separately
